console.log(12+20);
/* EXERCISE 2

*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */
let x = 12;


/* EXERCISE 3
Create a variable named name containing the string John Doe
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */
let name = "John Doe";
/* EXERCISE 4

*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

console.log(12-x);

/* EXERCISE 5
Create two variables: name1 and name 2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase
 (without changing the value of name2)
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */
let name1=john
let name2=John
console.log(name1 !== name2)
console.log(name1=== name2.toLowercase())
 

}
/* EXERCISE 6
Create the variable X (value less than 10). Write the code to print the literal value of the given number
 (ex.: 1 => one, 5 => five)
*/
let x=1;
Ä±f (x===1){
    console.log("one");
    elseif (x===2){
        console.log("two")

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */
let y;
y=(x===3 ? 105:" anything else");

if(x===3) {
    y=105;
} else{y="anything else"
}
/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
